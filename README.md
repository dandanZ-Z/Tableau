Brought forward and executed the idea of using Tableau to distribute freight rate information to anyone in the company. 
The dashboard is linked to the google sheet where we are able to put in the rates and Tablaeu will scrape and update the data accordingly.
The main challenge of this project was mapping out the multiple routes by coordinates as well as showing them on the same layer.
Much of the data has been removed due to company confidentiality.
